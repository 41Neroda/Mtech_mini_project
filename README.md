# Topic: "A review on Machine Translation models with emphasis on linguistic challenges in English-Manipuri translation"

In this mini-project, I have explored the existing papers in three sections: First is for the international languages, then in next section, the Machine Translation approaches that has been applied on the languages which are having similar linguistic structures with Manipuri language is studied. Finally, i have explored the techniques applied for the task of translation for English-Manipuri language pair. From the study, I observed that as a current trend, Neural Machine Translation model, specifically the Transformer-based model is applied for this task.

As of now, I have performed transliteration from Bengali script dataset to Meitei Mayek script dataset applying the same approach as in (Nongmeikapam et al., 2011). The parallel text corpus to perform transliteration is taken from the Google Research Github Repository (https://github.com/google-research-datasets/indic-gen-bench/blob/main/flores_in/flores_en_mni_dev.json) which is a subset of the FLORES-101 dataset.

Future work: Addition of more high-quality parallel corpora, applying transfer learning technique especially for this low-resource language (Manipuri).

Mini-Project duration: January 2025 - May 2025
